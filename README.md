# NumPy grant planning

We [have a grant](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2017-October/077264.html)
for improving NumPy! This repo is a scratch space we're using for planning.
This is probably mostly interesting to us here at Berkeley; any actual
proposals and code will go through NumPy's normal community review process.

For a high level overview, here's [a talk @njsmith gave at Berkeley about the
general plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fowHwlpGb34), and here's the
outcome metrics our funders are looking for:

> Technical goals:
> 
> - Creation and release of new NumPy dtype system, leading to substantial contribution of new data types by non-core developers and demonstrated usage in dependent software
> - Development of new array protocol, adopted by innovative research projects as evidenced by citations and Github trace data
> - Maintenance of a frequent and consistent NumPy release cycle
> 
> Social goals:
> 
> - Substantial growth in number of NumPy core maintainers as well as new contributors (with clear progress by the end of year 1 of work)
> - Demonstrated progress toward a more diverse and inclusive NumPy contributor community, reflected in contributor base as well as enabling policies like a code of conduct
