# NumPy Plan

## Technical goals

- Creation and release of new NumPy dtype system, leading to substantial contribution of new data types by non-core developers and demonstrated usage in dependent software
- Development of new array protocol, adopted by innovative research projects as evidenced by citations and Github trace data
- Maintenance of a frequent and consistent NumPy release cycle

## Social goals

- Substantial growth in number of NumPy core maintainers as well as new contributors (with clear progress by the end of year 1 of work)
- Demonstrated progress toward a more diverse and inclusive NumPy contributor community, reflected in contributor base as well as enabling policies like a code of conduct
